Overview
--------

.. note::
   
   AWS authentication is available only in the MongoDB Enterprise Edition for MongoDB 4.4
   and later.

The AWS authentication mechanism uses AWS `Identity and Access Management (IAM)
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html>`_
and AWS `Security Token Service (STS)
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html>`_
to prove the client's identity to a MongoDB server. AWS authentication
works as follows:

1. The client uses AWS IAM credentials to create a signature that is sent to
   the MongoDB server.
2. The server sends a request to AWS STS using the client's signature.
3. A successful STS request returns the username (technically, the ARN of
   the IAM user or role) corresponding to the credentials that the client used.
   The IAM user ARN is used by the server to look up a defined user, and the
   client is considered to have authenticated as this user.

.. note::

  Unlike other authentication mechanisms, the username that the application
  provides when creating a client and the username of the server user are
  different: the username on the client is the AWS access key ID, but the
  username on the server is the ARN of the IAM user or role corresponding
  to the access key ID.

AWS credentials are comprised of:

- The access key ID
- The secret access key
- The optional session token

Authentication with `AWS IAM credentials
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html>`_,
uses the access key ID and the secret access key. Authentication with
`temporary AWS IAM credentials
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html>`_
uses all three components.

.. note::

  The driver never sends the secret access key or the session token over
  the network.

Temporary credentials are used with:

- STS `Assume Role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-api.html>`_
  requests.
- `EC2 instance roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html>`_.
- `ECS task roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html>`_.
- `AWS Lambda environment <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html>`_.
- `IAM roles for service accounts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html>`_.

The {+driver-short+} allows providing both regular and temporary credentials
explicitly as {+language+} options or URI options. If you do not explicitly provide
credentials, the driver will attempt to retrieve them from environment variables
described below and from EC2 instance and ECS task metadata endpoints.

Code Placeholders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code examples on this page use the following placeholders:

- ``<hostname>``: The network address of your MongoDB deployment.
- ``<aws-access-key_id>``: The AWS access key ID.
- ``<aws_secret_access_key>``: The AWS secret access key.
- ``<aws_session_token>``: The AWS session token.

Using AWS IAM Authentication in Your Application
------------------------------------------------

The following sections describe how to use the AWS IAM authentication mechanism in your
application.

Providing Credentials Explicitly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide regular (non-temporary) IAM credentials as client options or by using a URI.
Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or :guilabel:`Client Options` tab to
see the corresponding syntax:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: default-connection-string

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication/aws-iam.rb
         :start-after: start-aws-connection-string
         :end-before: end-aws-connection-string
         :language: ruby
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

   .. tab:: Client Options
      :tabid: default-mongo-credential

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication/aws-iam.rb
         :start-after: start-aws
         :end-before: end-aws
         :language: ruby
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

.. note::

  When credentials are provided by using a URI, they must be percent-escaped.

Providing Temporary Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To provide temporary credentials, specify the session token in the
client options or by using a URI. Select the :guilabel:`Connection String`
or :guilabel:`Client Options` tab to see the corresponding syntax:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: default-connection-string

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication/aws-iam.rb
         :start-after: start-aws-temp-connection-string
         :end-before: end-aws-temp-connection-string
         :language: ruby
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

   .. tab:: Client Options
      :tabid: default-mongo-credential

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication/aws-iam.rb
         :start-after: start-aws-temp
         :end-before: end-aws-temp
         :language: ruby
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

Automatically Retrieving Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The client can retrieve credentials from the environment or from EC2 or ECS
metadata endpoints. To retrieve credentials automatically, specify the
AWS authentication mechanism but do not specify a username nor a password, either by using
client options or by using a URI. Select the :guilabel:`Connection String`
or :guilabel:`Client Options` tab to see the corresponding syntax:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: default-connection-string

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication/aws-iam.rb
         :start-after: start-aws-automatic-retrieval-connection-string
         :end-before: end-aws-automatic-retrieval-connection-string
         :language: ruby
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

   .. tab:: Client Options
      :tabid: default-mongo-credential

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication/aws-iam.rb
         :start-after: start-aws-automatic-retrieval
         :end-before: end-aws-automatic-retrieval
         :language: ruby
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

The driver will try to obtain credentials from the following sources, in
the specified order:

- ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``, ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` and ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN``
  environment variables. These environment variables are recognized by
  a variety of AWS-related libraries and tools such as the official
  AWS Ruby SDK and the AWS CLI. They are also defined when running in an
  AWS Lambda environment.
- The AWS STS `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity action
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html>`_.
  This returns credentials associated with the service account token. This mechanism
  requires the following environment variables to be set:

  - ``AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`` - path to a file containing the service
    account token.
  - ``AWS_ROLE_ARN`` - the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that the
    caller is assuming.
  - ``AWS_ROLE_SESSION_NAME`` (optional) - An identifier for the assumed role
    session. If omitted, a random name will be generated by the driver.

- The AWS `ECS task metadata endpoint
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html>`_.
  This returns credentials associated with the ECS task role assigned to
  the container.
- The AWS `EC2 instance metadata endpoint
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html>`_.
  This returns credentials associated with the EC2 instance role assigned to
  the instance.

.. note::

  A credentials source that provides any credentials must provide a complete
  set of credentials. For example, the driver will raise an error if only
  one of ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` or ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` environment
  variables is populated but not the other.

.. note::

  If an application is running in an ECS container on an EC2 instance and
  `the container is allowed access to the instance metadata
  <https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ecs-container-ec2-metadata/>`_,
  the driver will attempt to retrieve credentials for the AWS authentication
  mechanism from the EC2 instance metadata endpoint, thus potentially
  authenticating as the IAM role assigned to the EC2 instance, if it was not
  able to retrieve ECS task role credentials from the ECS task endpoint.
