Overview
--------

The Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI) authentication mechanism allows you to
use your principal name to authenticate to a Kerberos service.
You can use this mechanism only when authenticating to MongoDB Enterprise Advanced.

Code Placeholders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code examples on this page use the following placeholders:

- ``<username>``: Your LDAP username.
- ``<hostname>``: The network address of your MongoDB deployment.
- ``<port>``: The port number of your MongoDB deployment. If you omit this parameter,
  the driver uses the default port number (``27017``). You don't need to specify a port
  when connecting to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
- ``<authentication_db>``: The MongoDB database that contains the user's LDAP credentials.
  If you omit this parameter, the driver uses the default database (``admin``).

To use the code examples on this page, replace these placeholders with your own values.


Using GSSAPI Authentication in Your Application
-----------------------------------------------

To configure the MongoDB server to use Kerberos, please refer to the
:manual:`server Kerberos documentation
</tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication/>`.

To use the Kerberos authentication mechanism with the Ruby MongoDB driver,
an additional library implementing the Kerberos authenticator -
`mongo_kerberos <https://rubygems.org/gems/mongo_kerberos>`_ - must be
installed and loaded. To do so, add the following lines to your ``Gemfile``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  gem 'mongo', '~> 2'
  gem 'mongo_kerberos', '~> 2'

Then, add the following lines to your application code:

.. code-block:: ruby

  require 'mongo'
  require 'mongo_kerberos'

If using Kerberos authentication with **MRI**, the password is not specified
in driver configuration and it is not sent to the MongoDB server by the driver.
Instead a Kerberos session must be established externally to the driver
and this session is used by the driver to prove the user's identity to
the server. Establishing this session requires that the host system is
configured for Kerberos authentication; see the `Kerberos documentation
<https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/admin/install_clients.html>`_
or your operating system documentation for details. Use the `kinit utility
<https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/user/user_commands/kinit.html>`_
to establish a Kerberos session.

If using Kerberos authentication with **JRuby**, the Kerberos session may
be estabished externally to the driver using the process described above
for MRI; alternatively, the password may be provided directly to the driver
by using client configuration, or the path to a keytab file may be provided by using
configuration stored in the ``java.security.auth.login.config`` system property.
Additionally, the Java runtime environment must be configured for Kerberos. See the 
`MongoDB Java Driver Kerberos documentation
<https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.0/driver/tutorials/authentication/#gssapi>`_
for more information.

.. note::

  Per the server Kerberos documentation, the FQDN of the host
  running MongoDB must be specified when using Kerberos authentication.

.. note::

  If using MongoDB URIs, be sure to percent-escape special characters like
  ``/`` and ``@`` when they appear in the username.

Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or :guilabel:`Client Options` tab to
see the corresponding syntax for connecting to MongoDB with Kerberos authentication:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: connection-string

      .. code-block:: ruby

         client = Mongo::Client.new("mongodb://<username>@<hostname>[:<port>]/<authentication_db>?authMechanism=GSSAPI")


   .. tab:: Client Options
      :tabid: mongo-credential

      .. code-block:: ruby
         :emphasize-lines: 1

         client = Mongo::Client.new(['<hostname>[:<port>]'],
                                    auth_mech: :gssapi,
                                    user: 'myapp/appuser@MYREALM')
