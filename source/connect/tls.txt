Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
protocol to secure your connection to a MongoDB deployment.

To connect to a MongoDB deployment using TLS, you must:

- Enable TLS connections in ``Mongo::Client``.
- Specify the client TLS certificate.
- Specify the CA certificate to verify the server's TLS certificate.

To learn how to configure your MongoDB deployment for TLS, see the
:manual:`TLS configuration guide </tutorial/configure-ssl/>` in the
{+mdb-server+} manual.

.. note::

   This page assumes prior knowledge of TLS/SSL and access to valid certificates.
   A full description of TLS/SSL, PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) certificates, and
   Certificate Authorities (CAs) is beyond the scope of this documentation. To
   learn more about TLS, see the Wikipedia entry for :wikipedia:`Transport Layer Security <Transport_Layer_Security>`.

Enable TLS
----------

You can enable TLS for the connection to your MongoDB deployment in the following ways:

- Set the ``ssl`` option to ``true`` in a new ``Mongo:Client`` object
- Set the ``tls`` option to ``true`` in your connection string

.. note:: The {+driver-long+} does not support SSL

    All {+mdb-server+} versions supported by the Ruby driver (2.6 and higher) 
    only implement TLS. 2.6 and do not use SSL.
    
    For historical reasons, the Ruby option names pertaining to TLS configuration 
    use the ``ssl`` rather than the ``tls`` prefix. The next major version of the Ruby 
    driver (3.0) will use the ``tls`` prefix for Ruby option names.

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Mongo::Client
        :tabid: mongoclient

        You must specify the following options for certificate paths:

        - ``ssl_cert``: The certificate file used to identify the connection against MongoDB.
        - ``ssl_key``: The private keyfile used to identify the connection against MongoDB.
        - ``ssl_ca_cert``: The file containing the concatenated certificate authority (CA)
          certificates used to validate certs passed from the other end of the connection.
          By default, the driver will use the default system root certificate 
          store as the trust anchor, if the option is not designated. 

        These certificate options can be specified as different types. For example, the 
        ``ssl_cert`` option has the alternative ``ssl_cert_object`` and ``ssl_cert_string`` 
        options to specify the certificate file as either a certificate object or a string.
        For more information on certificate options, see Options Hash section of 
        the API Documentation for `Mongo::Client <{+api-root+}/Mongo/Client.html>`__.  

        In the following example, the TLS certificate and corresponding private key 
        are provided in separate files:

        .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.rb
            :language: ruby
            :dedent:
            :start-after: start-enable-tls-settings
            :end-before: end-enable-tls-settings
        
        The TLS certificate and private key can also be contained in the same file, but 
        both the certificate and private key options must still be specified. In the 
        following example, the TLS certificate and the private key are both defined 
        in the same ``client.pem`` file:

        .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.rb
            :language: ruby
            :dedent:
            :start-after: start-enable-tls-settings-same-file
            :end-before: end-enable-tls-settings-same-file

    .. tab:: Connection String
        :tabid: uri

        You must specify the following URI options:
        
        - ``tlsCertificateKeyFile``: The certificate and key file used to identify
          identify the connection against MongoDB. Both the certificate and key
          must be stored in the same file provided to this option.
        - ``tlsCAFile``: The file containing the concatenated certificate authority (CA)
          certificates used to validate certificates passed from the other end of the 
          connection. The driver will use the default system root certificate 
          store as the trust anchor, if the option is not designated. 

        .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.rb
            :language: ruby
            :dedent:
            :start-after: start-enable-tls-uri
            :end-before: end-enable-tls-uri
        
        The file containing the certificate and key usually has a``.crt`` or ``.pem`` 
        extension.

        URI option values must be properly URI escaped. This applies, for example, 
        to slashes (/) in the paths, which are encoded as ``%2f``.

Modify the SSL Context
----------------------

If your TLS configuration requires customization, you can set TLS context hooks
by adding a native Ruby class ``Proc`` object to the ``Mongo.tls_context_hooks`` 
array. The ``Proc`` should be added to the array before creating any ``Mongo::Client`` 
instances. 

For example, the following code could be placed in an initializer to enable the 
AES256-SHA cipher as the only cipher to be used for TLS:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.rb
    :language: ruby
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-modify-context
    :end-before: end-modify-context

To learn more about the SSL context options available, see the Ruby
documentation for 
`SSLContext <https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html>`__.

OCSP Verification
-----------------

If the certificate provided by the server contains an OCSP endpoint URI,
the driver will issue an OCSP request to the specified endpoint to verify the
validity of the certificate by default.

The OCSP endpoint check may be disabled by setting the
``:ssl_verify_ocsp_endpoint`` Ruby option to ``false`` or by setting the
``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` URI option to ``true`` when creating a client.

.. note::

  OCSP endpoint checking is not currently performed when running on JRuby,
  since JRuby does not correctly expose the OCSP endpoint URI.
