Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the **write concern**, **read concern**, and
**read preference** configurations to modify the way that MongoDB runs
create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on replica sets.

You can set write concern, read concern, and read preference options at the following
levels:

- Client, which sets the *default for all operation executions* unless overridden
- Session
- Transaction
- Database
- Collection

This list also indicates the increasing order of precedence of the option settings. For
example, if you set a read concern level for a transaction, it will override a read
concern level set for the client.

These options allow you to customize the causal consistency and availability of the data
in your replica sets.

Write Concern
-------------

The write concern specifies the level of acknowledgement requested from MongoDB for 
write operations, such as an insert or update, before the operation successfully returns.
Operations that do not specify an explicit write concern inherit the global default write
concern settings.

For more information, see :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>` in the
Server manual. For detailed API documentation, see the `Write Concern API documentation
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ruby-driver/current/api/Mongo/Client.html#write_concern-instance_method>`__.

The following table describes the ``write_concern`` parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
  
   * - ``w`` *(optional)*
     - integer or string
     - Requests acknowledgment that the write operation has propagated to a specified
       number of ``mongod`` instances or to ``mongod`` instances that are labelled
       specified tags.

   * - ``wtimeoutMS`` *(optional)*
     - integer
     - Specifies a time limit to prevent write operations from blocking indefinitely.

   * - ``journal`` *(optional)*
     - boolean
     - Requests acknowledgment that the write operation has been written to the 
     on-disk journal.

Example: Set the Write Concern for a Single Write Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code uses custom ``write_concern`` settings while creating new a document:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/read-write-pref.rb
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-write-concern
   :end-before: end-write-concern

Example: Retrieve and Apply an Existing Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code uses the ``with_write_concern`` method to construct a ``write_concern`` from
the options of an existing database reference, ``myDB``. ``myDB`` can be 
replaced with a reference to any entity that accepts a write concern option. 
Then the new write concern is applied to a document, ``myDoc``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/read-write-pref.rb
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-write-concern-2
   :end-before: end-write-concern-2

Read Concern
------------

The read concern specifies the following behaviors:

- Level of :manual:`causal consistency </core/causal-consistency-read-write-concerns/>`
  across replica sets

- `Isolation guarantees <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/current/core/read-isolation-consistency-recency/>`__ 
  maintained during a query 

You can specify the read concern setting by using the ``level`` parameter. The default
read concern level is ``local``. This means that the client returns the data from the
replica set member that the client is connected to, with no guarantee that the data has
been written to all replica set members.

.. note::
    Lower read concern level requirements may reduce latency. 

For more information about read concerns or read concern levels, see 
:manual:`Read Concern </reference/read-concern/>` in the Server manual. For more
detail on the ``read_concern`` type and definitions of the read concern levels, see
the `Read Concern <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ruby-driver/current/api/Mongo/Client.html#read_concern-instance_method>`__ 
in the API documentation.

Example: Set the Read Concern Level of an Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code sets the read concern level of an aggregation to `"available"`:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/read-write-pref.rb
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-read-concern
   :end-before: end-read-concern

For more information about aggregates, see the `ruby-aggregation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ruby-driver/upcoming/reference/aggregation/>`_ 
page.

Example: Change the Read Concern of a Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code changes the read concern level of a database to ``"local"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/read-write-pref.rb
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-change-read-concern
   :end-before: end-change-read-concern

Read Preference
---------------

The read preference determines which member of a replica set MongoDB reads when running a
query. You can also customize how the server evaluates members. 

For more detailed API documentation, see the `Read Preference API
documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ruby-driver/current/api/Mongo/Collection/View/Readable.html#read_preference-instance_method>`__.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``mode``
     - ``Symbol``
     - Specifies a requirement or preference for which replica set
       member the server reads from. The default mode, ``:primary``, specifies that
       operations read from the primary member of the replica set.

   * - ``tags`` *(optional)*
     - ``Array<Hash>``
     - Assigns tags to secondary replica set members to customize how the server evaluates
       them. Tags cannot be used with the ``:primary`` read preference mode setting.

   * - ``options`` *(optional)*
     - ``Hash``
     - Sets various options, including :manual:`hedge </core/read-preference-hedge-option/>`
       and :manual:`maxStalenessSeconds </core/read-preference-staleness/>` that can be
       applied to your read preference.

Example: Set Read Preference and Concerns for a Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code sets the read preference, read concern, and write concern for the operations in
a transaction:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/read-write-pref.rb
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-read-preference
   :end-before: end-read-preference

For more information about transactions, see `ruby-transactions <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ruby-driver/upcoming/reference/transactions/>`_.

Example: Set the Read Preference of a Cluster in the Connection String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code example creates a MongoClient that uses the "secondary" read preference mode
when performing queries on a cluster:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/read-write-pref.rb
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-read-preference-cluster
   :end-before: end-read-preference-cluster

This example also sets the ``maxStalenessSeconds`` option. For more information 
about connection string options, see the :manual:`Connection String Options </reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options>`
section in the manual.
